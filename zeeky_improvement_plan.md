        self.providers = {
            "openai": OpenAIProvider(),
            "anthropic": AnthropicProvider(),
            "google": GoogleProvider(),
            "local": LocalAIProvider(),
            "free": FreeAIProvider()
        }
    
    async def get_response(self, message, fallback_chain=["openai", "anthropic", "google", "local", "free"]):
        for provider in fallback_chain:
            try:
                return await self.providers[provider].chat(message)
            except Exception as e:
