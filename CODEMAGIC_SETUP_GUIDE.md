3. Connect your repository: `joachimaross/ZEEKYAI1.00`

### 2. **Repository Configuration**

The configuration files are already committed to your repository. Now you need to:

```bash
# Verify the files are in place
git status
git log --oneline -5

# The codemagic.yaml should be in your root directory
ls -la codemagic.yaml
```

### 3. **Environment Variables Setup**

In Codemagic dashboard, go to your app settings and add these environment variables:

#### **Expo Credentials Group**
```
EXPO_TOKEN=your_expo_access_token
EAS_PROJECT_ID=zeeky-ai-mobile-project
```

#### **Google Play Group**
```
GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS=your_service_account_json
GOOGLE_PLAY_TRACK=internal
```

#### **App Store Credentials Group**
```
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=your_issuer_id
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER=your_key_id
APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

#### **Netlify Credentials Group**
```
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_netlify_token
NETLIFY_SITE_ID=your_site_id
```

### 4. **Code Signing Setup**

#### **Android Signing**
1. Generate a keystore file for Android signing
2. Upload keystore to Codemagic
3. Add keystore reference to environment variables

#### **iOS Signing**
1. Add your Apple Developer account to Codemagic
2. Configure automatic code signing
3. Update bundle identifier in `app.json`

### 5. **App Store Connect Configuration**

#### **iOS Setup**
1. Create app record in App Store Connect
2. Update `APP_ID` in `codemagic.yaml` with your app ID
3. Configure TestFlight beta testing

#### **Android Setup**
1. Create app in Google Play Console
2. Generate service account JSON
3. Upload to Codemagic environment variables
